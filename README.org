* CCI Data Process

  This project is meant to be a library/WEB API for facilitating
  common data processing tasks at the University of Maine.

* Requirements

  The project is built using Python 3, so the Python 3.5 system is
  required.  Furthermore, the system requires the following python
  libraries that may be installed either through pip or through the
  Debian apt repositories.

  |------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | Library    | Apt                | Description                                               |
  |------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | Pandas     | python3-pandas     | Data structures for "relational" or "labeled" data        |
  | matlabplot | python3-matlabplot | Python based plotting system in a style similar to Matlab |
  | bottle     | python3-bottle     | Python library for creating web interfaces                |
  |------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|

* Building and Testing

  The source code for the project is located in the [[file:src]]
  directory.  Test files are unsurprisingly found in the [[file:test]]
  directory.

  To run all of the unit tests for the project execute the following.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python -m unittest discover
#+END_SRC

* Generating Documentation

  The project is documented using [[http:www.sphinx-doc.org]] style
  comments.  In order to build the documentation the sphinx must be
  installed.  On Debian-like systems the required package is
  =python3-sphinx=.

  In order to generate the project documentation html =cd= to the
  [[file:doc]] directory and execute the following.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make html
#+END_SRC

  This will generate the HTML documentation for the project and place
  it in [[file:doc/_build/html]].
